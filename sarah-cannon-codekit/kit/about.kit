Bringing the most innovative medical minds together with the most passionate caregivers in their communities, we are transforming care and personalizing treatment. Through clinical excellence and cutting edge research, Sarah Cannon is redefining cancer care around the world. </p>
            <h2 class="section-subheader">The Impact of Cancer</h2>
            <p>
              The impact of cancer on our society is profound, as supported by sobering statistics. Within a few years, cancer is expected to surpass heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. It is estimated that one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, with 1.6 million Americans diagnosed in 2011. Each and every one of us has had a family member, friend, or colleague affected by this disease.
              <br>
              <br>
              The landscape of cancer treatment continues to evolve. Personalized cancer care that incorporates molecular profiling is the new standard approach, affording physicians the tools to “treat the right patient with the right therapy at the right time.” Improved treatment allows more people to survive their cancer. Currently, approximately one in 20 adult Americans is a cancer survivor, more than 10 million in total. That number is expected to increase to 20 million by 2020 and 30 million by 2030. Today, approximately 65 percent of cancer survivors have lived at least five years since diagnosis.
