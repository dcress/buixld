            <p>Levofloxacin (trade names Levaquin (US), Tavanic (EU), and others) is a broad spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class,[1] and the levo isomer of its predecessor ofloxacin. Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Gram positive (methicillin-sensitive but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), and atypical bacterial pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Compared to earlier antibiotics of the fluoroquinoline class such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin exhibits greater activity toward Gram-(+) bacteria[2] but lesser activity toward Gram-(−) bacteria,[3] especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Levofloxacin and later generation fluoroquinolones are collectively referred to as "respiratory quinolones" to distinguish them from earlier fluoroquinolones which exhibited modest activity toward the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.</p>

            <p>Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are valued for their broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and for their availability in both oral and intravenous formulations.[5] Levafloxacin is used alone or in combination with other antibacterial drugs to treat certain bacterial infections including pneumonia,[6] urinary tract infections,[7][8] and abdominal infections.</p>

            <p>Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated, but in rare instances have produced serious adverse reactions such as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy.[10] Tendon damage may manifest months after therapy had been completed. Levofloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems.</p>

            <p>Most adverse reactions are mild to moderate; however, sometimes serious adverse effects occur. There is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.</p>

            <p>In pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxcacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates.</p>

            <p>Other less common but serious adverse effects have been observed both in clinical trials as well as in reviews of post-approval spontaneous adverse event reports. Prominent among these is the potential for tendon damage, including rupture of the Achilles tendon, which is the subject of a black box warning in the official prescribing informations for all fluoroquinolones in the United States. Injury, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to 6 months after cessation of treatment; the elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical corticosteroid use are at elevated risk. A population-based study in the Netherlands estimated that between 1 and 15 fluoroquinolone-attributable tendon ruptures resulted from 318,000 fluoroquinoline prescriptions in 1996. A detailed overview of risk factors for fluoroquinolone-associated tendon rupture has been published; advanced age, concurrent treatment with corticosteroids, and higher doses of fluoroquinolone appear to be the most important risk factors. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease myasthenia gravis.</p>

            <p>Levofloxacin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name "Tavanic" in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and South America, and by the Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson in the United States.</p>

            <p>Levofloxacin was first patented in 1987 (Levofloxacin European patent by Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 20 December 1996 for use in the United States to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.</p>

            <p>The term of the levofloxacin United States patent was extended by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office under the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Amendment. Under the terms of Hatch-Waxman, the patent terms of pharmaceutical products that contain a novel active ingredient are extended by up to five years to compensate the developer for the patent life lost while performing clinical trials and other activities required to fulfill regulatory requirements. This extension was challenged by generic drug manufacturer Lupin Pharmaceuticals who argued that since levofloxacin is a single isomer of the previously approved antibacterial ofloxacin, it is not a "novel active ingredient" and thus ineligible for patent term extension. The federal patent court ruled in favor of Ortho McNeil, and generic versions of levofloxacin did not enter the U.S. market until 2009.</p>
