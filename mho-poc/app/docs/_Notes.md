# Work Notes

## Enrollment 
  ### for the "Flip Card" effect:
  - http://davidwalsh.name/css-flip
  - http://css3playground.com/3d-flip-cards/
  - https://github.com/peachananr/tip_cards
  - https://github.com/mintchaos/flippant.js
  - need to decide to either do the CSS3 version with graceful degradation (meaning that IE7-9 will get immediate show/hide and no animation) or to use Flippant.js in order for it to render in all browsers.

  ### Background Image Blur:
  - Use CSS3 blur filter
  -
