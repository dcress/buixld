# ACCESSIBILITY NOTES:

## Modals:
  - Make modals accessible
  - Be sure to add role="dialog" to .modal, aria-labelledby="myModalLabel"  attribute to reference the modal title, and aria-hidden="true" to tell assistive technologies to skip the modal's DOM elements.
  - Additionally, you may give a description of your modal dialog with aria-  describedby on .modal.
  - ADD aria-hidden="true" and an alt="(with description)" to all icon html tags.
